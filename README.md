# OMQ Assist for Freshdesk

## Overview

AI-powered knowledge base - search answers and automate replies.

## Description

[OMQ Assist](https://www.omq.ai/products/assist/) is integrated in Freshdesk as an app. It helps customer service agents to answer more efficient and faster. The self-learning knowledge base automatically suggests suitable solutions. 


## Artificial intelligence

With our [artificial intelligence](https://www.omq.ai/blog/artificial-intelligence-in-customer-service/), incoming customer messages will be automatically read. Simultaneously, OMQ Assist analyzes and understands the intention of the customer request. Text blocks will be displayed to the service agent so that they can compose an email reply with a single click. Manually replying to repetitive customer requests will therefore be avoided.


## All languages

The OMQ system works in 32 languages. When an agent opens a ticket or email than the language is automatically detected. The language is changed and the system 

- Solve requests from all over the world (supports 32 languages)






## Search

You can also individually search for an answer if you want to use a different answer than the one suggested by OMQ Assist. Just enter a search term in the search field. OMQ Assist displays all entries for this search term. The number in the first place indicates how many entries for the term are stored in the knowledge base as a whole. Below is listed which specific entries there are related to the term and how many of them exist.



## About OMQ

## Instructions

How to install the Freshdesk app

Install the plugin. Click on the OMQ tab on the left menu sidebar to create a new OMQ account. Follow the instructions https://www.omq.ai/blog/freshdesk-omq-assist/.

Integration with Freshdesk uses an API key. This is used to identify the connection in the ticket system. New customers create a free OMQ account during the integration process. The API is generated automatically in the process. OMQ customers who already have an account can generate an API key for a new Assist connection in the OMQ knowledge base under the Assist module. This is automatically generated via the plus-icon in the left corner.
